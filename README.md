## Problems for nowdays

1) Redirect works awful (History)
2) Structure is not correct. Nice to refactor it. 
For example :
* add indexes to all components
* Split view and logic to jsx and js files

3) Nice to make auth more clear. 
It's splited for 2 file - authentication.service and AuthProvider,
 but those files are almost the same.
